    "**Problem Statement**: LoanTap, an online platform offering customized loan products, is facing challenges in efficiently assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. By predicting the likelihood of default, the company aims to minimize risks and improve the decision-making process for loan approvals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an applicant will default on a personal loan, based on their financial and credit history attributes. The model should help LoanTap make data-driven decisions, reducing the overall risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Overview**: LoanTap has provided a dataset containing various financial and credit-related features for loan applicants. Below is a summary of the dataset:\n",

    "**Aim**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To analyze which factors are critical in determining whether a borrower will default on a personal loan.\n",
    "2. To develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of loan default based on borrower attributes.\n",
    "3. Ensure interpretability of the model so LoanTap can understand the key drivers of defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods and Techniques used:** EDA, feature engineering, modeling using sklearn pipelines, hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measure of Performance and Minimum Threshold to reach the business objective** : Recall > 90% and  precision > 70% \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "* The dataset is assumed to be representative of LoanTap’s entire customer base.\n",
    "* The data remains stable over time, and thus, the model is assumed not to decay rapidly.\n",
    "* External factors (e.g., economic downturns) are not considered, though they could influence loan repayment behavior."
